<Graduation Project Overview

Our graduation project consisted of two main components focusing on API testing and automation testing, complemented by comprehensive manual test case documentation using Jira. These components were designed to showcase our expertise in software testing, leveraging modern tools, methodologies, and best practices to ensure software quality. Below is a detailed description of our work:
1. API Testing Using Dummy JSON API

    Project Repository: Dummy JSON API Testing

    Objective: The goal of this part of the project was to test the reliability and performance of a dummy JSON API. This API simulates a real-world RESTful service, and we performed functional testing to validate its endpoints.

    Tasks Accomplished:
        Designed and executed manual test cases using Jira to cover various scenarios for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods.
        Verified responses against expected results, focusing on status codes, response times, and data validation.
        Automated these tests using tools like Postman and custom scripts in JavaScript to streamline testing and ensure consistency.

    Outcome: We ensured that the API behaved correctly under different scenarios, providing insights into its potential for integration in software systems. This showcased our skills in both manual and automated API testing.

2. Automation Testing on Swag Labs

    Project Repository: Swag DEPI Automation Testing

    Objective: The focus of this part was to create automated test suites for the Swag Labs website, a mock e-commerce platform, to validate its functionality various scenarios.

    Tasks Accomplished:
        Created detailed manual test cases in Jira to map out different functional testing scenarios.
        Built automated test cases using Selenium WebDriver integrated with Java and the TestNG framework.
        Conducted cross-browser testing to ensure consistency across different browsers.
        Implemented reporting features to document automated test results and compared them with manual test outcomes.

    Outcome: By combining manual and automation testing, we demonstrated proficiency in building robust, reusable, and scalable test frameworks. This approach significantly reduced manual testing efforts while ensuring software quality.

Manual Testing in Jira

    We documented all test cases in Jira as part of the manual testing process.
    Each test case included:
        Test Case ID
        Test Scenario Description
        Steps to Reproduce
        Expected Results
        Actual Results
        Status (Pass/Fail)
        proirity
    Jira allowed us to effectively track test execution, report defects, and collaborate as a team to ensure that all test cases were thoroughly reviewed and executed.

Technologies and Tools Used

    API Testing: Postman, JavaScript, Dummy JSON API
    Automation Testing: Selenium WebDriver, Java, TestNG, Maven
    Manual Testing: Jira for test case documentation and defect tracking
    Collaboration: GitHub for version control and team collaboration
